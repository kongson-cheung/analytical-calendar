# Analytical Calendar

Analytical Calendar is an innovative design for time intelligence in Qlik dashboards.  It fully integrates into the green-white-grey design and fits very well into the associative data model. 

Instead of having complicated calculations in the set analysis, it tries to incorporate all the calculations inside the data model such that once you select, the dashboard reflects directly.

Date looks easy but very complicated.  You might feel it when you apply selection and change it.  If you are a developer, you must understand the pain!

So, here, the analytical calendar has a new design:
1. Unique Date (i.e. 2025, 2025-Q1, 2025-Jan, 2025-W1, 2025-01-01, etc.)  All uniqueness of representing a date range.
2. Analysis Perspective (Actual, YTD, MTD, QTD, YTM, rolling, etc), all valid and possible date range representation.
3. Comparison Perspective (1 day before, 1 month before, 2 weeks before, etc) all valid and possible comparison.

Take a look and enjoy!

* I am trying to manipulate the same in Tableau and PowerBI but because of the fundamental differences of query-based vs assocaitive model, it might not fully show the power of the analytical calendar.   Welcome comments and suggestions. Thanks!


## The analytical calendar for 2022 to 2026 is available.
- [ANALYTICAL_CALENDAR.qvd](https://github.com/kongson-cheung/analytical-calendar/raw/refs/heads/main/Analytical%20Calendar%20QVD/2022-2026/ANALYTICAL_CALENDAR.qvd)
- [DIM_CALENDAR.qvd](https://github.com/kongson-cheung/analytical-calendar/raw/refs/heads/main/Analytical%20Calendar%20QVD/2022-2026/DIM_CALENDAR.qvd)
- [LINKED_TABLE_DATE_RANGE.qvd](https://github.com/kongson-cheung/analytical-calendar/blob/main/Analytical%20Calendar%20QVD/2022-2026/LINKED_TABLE_DATE_RANGE.qvd)

Load these three tables (e.g. using web file) and then load your Fact table with a date field as %DATE_KEY.  You can start enjoy the benefit of the analytical calendar.

In general, you will just need two similar expressions.
- analysis period, sum({<[Comparison Perspective]={'N/A'}>} Exp1)
- comparison period, sum(Exp1)

All charts are now integrated to the green-white-grey with both the analysis period and comparison period!!

Enjoy!
