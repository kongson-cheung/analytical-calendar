# Analytical Calendar

Analytical Calendar is an innovative design for time intelligence in Qlik dashboards.  It fully integrates into the green-white-grey design and fits very well into the associative data model. 

Instead of having complicated calculations in the set analysis, it tries to incorporate all the calculations inside the data model such that once you select, the dashboard reflects directly.

Date looks easy but very complicated.  You might feel it when you apply selection and change it.  If you are a developer, you must understand the pain!

So, here, the analytical calendar has a new design:
1. Unique Date (i.e. 2025, 2025-Q1, 2025-Jan, 2025-W1, 2025-01-01, etc.)  All uniqueness of representing a date range.
2. Analysis Perspective (Actual, YTD, MTD, QTD, YTM, rolling, etc), all valid and possible date range representation.
3. Comparison Perspective (1 day before, 1 month before, 2 weeks before, etc) all valid and possible comparison.
